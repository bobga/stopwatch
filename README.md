# stopwatch

Stopwatch App

## Getting Started

This requirement of this project is below.

- As a user I want to be able to start the stopwatch so that I can begin tracking time

- As a user I want to be able to stop the stopwatch so that I can end tracking time

- As a user I want to be able to optionally track laps

- When tracking laps, I want to know what order they were tracked in

- When tracking laps, I want to know how many there are

- As a user I want to be able to reset the stopwatch

- Resetting means that all laps are reset

- Resetting means that overall time is also reset
